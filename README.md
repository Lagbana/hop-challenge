### Deployed App
https://nibbles-event.herokuapp.com/

The main problems:
1. Find the emails of participants who purchased real products at an event.
2. Find the products bought at the event.
3. Calculate the total purchases at the event.
4. Calculate the total remaining balance of the purchasing participants.

Assumptions

1. Leftover balance refers to total leftover balance of all purchasing participants.
2. Consumer device type will vary so data display should be responsive.
3. There will likely be more questions to answer in the future so api design should be flexible.
4. Data from API doesn't need to be stored.
